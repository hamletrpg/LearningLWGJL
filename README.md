Learning opengl, Using Java for now, until I learn how to link external libraries in c/c++ lol

Learning Resources are GamesWithGabe and ThinMatrix channels

Also  Game Engine Architecture Book by Jason Gregory ;)

Nice material, I'll be working on my own library using c/c++ opengl and glfw so I'll stop updating this repo.

this is nothing crazy, just trying to use a Java wrapper to interact with opengl
